# CAP-5415 : Computer Vision Project by Alexis BENAMIRA & Dugan DOBBS

This repository contain the final project of the CAP-5415 : Computer Vision Class

This project is about detectipon, tracking and classification of faces.


## Getting Started

### Live demo

For a live demo, download the repository and launch LiveModel.ipynb.

### Further details

For further implementation details please see the other functions

## Done ourself

During this class I have implemented:
* Feauture extraction using VGGFace2
* Distance metric evaluations
* Face detection
* Face Classification

## Dataset

The dataset (contained in Data) is composed of pictures of mumbers of the Computer Vision Group at UCF.
